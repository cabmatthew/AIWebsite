                     MotionID: Towards practical behavioral biometrics-based implicit user authentication on smartphones

                    Traditional one-time authentication mechanisms cannot authenticate smartphone users’ identities throughout the session – the concept of using behavioral-based biometrics
                    captured by the built-in motion sensors and touch data is a candidate to solve this issue. Many studies proposed solutions for behavioral-based continuous authentication;
                    however, they are still far from practicality and generality for real-world usage. To date, no commercially deployed implicit user authentication scheme exists because most of
                    those solutions were designed to improve detection accuracy without addressing real-world deployment requirements. To bridge this gap, we tackle the limitations of existing
                    schemes and reach toward developing a more practical implicit authentication scheme, dubbed MotionID, based on a one-class detector using behavioral data from motion sensors
                    when users touch their smartphones. Compared with previous studies, our work addresses the following challenges: 1) Global mobile average to dynamically adjust the sampling rate
                    for sensors on any device and mitigate the impact of using sensors’ fixed sampling rate; 2) Over-all-apps to authenticate a user across all the mobile applications,
                    not only on-specific application; 3) Single-device-evaluation to measure the performance with multiple users’ (i.e., genuine users and imposters) data collected from the
                    same device; 4) Rapid authentication to quickly identify users’ identities using a few samples collected within short durations of touching (1–5 s) the device;
                    5) Unconditional settings to collect sensor data from real-world smartphone usage rather than a laboratory study. To show the feasibility of MotionID for those challenges,
                    we evaluated the performance of MotionID with ten users’ motion sensor data on five different smartphones under various settings.
                    Our results show the impracticality of using a fixed sampling rate across devices that most previous studies have adopted. MotionID is able to authenticate users with an
                    F1-score up to 98.5% for some devices under practical requirements and an F1-score up to roughly 90% when considering the drift concept and rapid authentication settings.
                    Finally, we investigate time efficiency, power consumption, and memory usage considerations to examine the practicality of MotionID.

                    Deep Learning (DL) is rapidly maturing to the point that it can be used in safety- and security-crucial applications,
                    such as self-driving vehicles, surveillance, drones, and robots. However, adversarial samples, which are undetectable to the human eye,
                    pose a serious threat that can cause the model to misbehave and compromise the performance of such applications. Addressing the robustness of
                    DL models has become crucial to understanding and defending against adversarial attacks. In this study, we perform a series of experiments to examine
                    the effect of adversarial attacks and defenses on various model architectures across well-known datasets. Our research focuses on black-box attacks such as SimBA,
                    HopSkipJump, MGAAttack, and boundary attacks, as well as preprocessor-based defensive mechanisms, including bits squeezing, median smoothing, and JPEG filter.
                    Experimenting with various models, our results demonstrate that the level of noise needed for the attack increases as the number of layers increases.
                    Moreover, the attack success rate decreases as the number of layers increases. This indicates that model complexity and robustness have a significant relationship.
                    Investigating the diversity and robustness relationship, our experiments with diverse models show that having a large number of parameters does not imply higher robustness.
                    Our experiments extend to show the effects of the training dataset on model robustness. Using various datasets such as ImageNet-1000, CIFAR-100, and CIFAR-10 are used to
                    evaluate the black-box attacks. Considering the multiple dimensions of our analysis, e.g., model complexity and training dataset, we examined the behavior of black-box
                    attacks when models apply defenses. Our results show that applying defense strategies can significantly reduce attack effectiveness.
                    This research provides in-depth analysis and insight into the robustness of DL models against various attacks, and defenses.

                    Rapid advancements of deep learning are accelerating adoption in a wide variety of applications, including safety-critical applications such as self-driving vehicles,
                    drones, robots, and surveillance systems. These advancements include applying variations of sophisticated techniques that improve the performance of models. However,
                    such models are not immune to adversarial manipulations, which can cause the system to misbehave and remain unnoticed by experts. The frequency of modifications to
                    existing deep learning models necessitates thorough analysis to determine the impact on models' robustness. In this work, we present an experimental evaluation of the
                    effects of model modifications on deep learning model robustness using adversarial attacks. Our methodology involves examining the robustness of variations of models against

                    Deep learning methods have gained increasing attention in various applications due to their outstanding performance.
                    For exploring how this high performance relates to the proper use of data artifacts and the accurate problem formulation of a given task, interpretation models have become a crucial component in developing deep learning-based systems.
                    Interpretation models enable the understanding of the inner workings of deep learning models and offer a sense of security in detecting the misuse of artifacts in the input data.
                    Similar to prediction models, interpretation models are also susceptible to adversarial inputs. This work introduces two attacks, AdvEdg and AdvEdge+, which deceive both the target deep learning model and the coupled interpretation model.
                    We assess the effectiveness of proposed attacks against four deep learning model architectures coupled with four interpretation models that represent different categories of interpretation models. Our experiments include the implementation of attacks using various attack frameworks.
                    We also explore the attack resilience against three general defense mechanisms and potential countermeasures.
                    Our analysis shows the effectiveness of our attacks in terms of deceiving the deep learning models and their interpreters, and highlights insights to improve and circumvent the attacks.

                    Both CT and MRI images are acquired for HDR prostate brachytherapy patients at our institution. CT is used to identify catheters and MRI is used to segment the prostate.

                    Target and organ delineation during prostate high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy treatment planning can be improved by acquiring both a postimplant CT and MRI. However, this leads to a longer treatment delivery workflow and may introduce uncertainties due to anatomical motion between scans. We investigated the dosimetric and workflow impact of MRI synthesized from CT for prostate HDR brachytherapy.
                    Seventy-eight CT and T2-weighted MRI datasets from patients treated with prostate HDR brachytherapy at our institution were retrospectively collected to train and validate our deep-learning-based image-synthesis method. Synthetic MRI was assessed against real MRI using the dice similarity coefficient (DSC) between prostate contours drawn using both image sets. The DSC between the same observer's synthetic and real MRI prostate contours was compared with the DSC between two different observers’ real MRI prostate contours. New treatment plans were generated targeting the synthetic MRI-defined prostate and compared with the clinically delivered plans using target coverage and dose to critical organs.
                    Variability between the same observer's prostate contours from synthetic and real MRI was not significantly different from the variability between different observer's prostate contours on real MRI. Synthetic MRI-planned target coverage was not significantly different from that of the clinically delivered plans. There were no increases above organ institutional dose constraints in the synthetic MRI plans.

                    With increased privacy concerns, anonymity tools such as VPNs and Tor have become popular. However, the packet metadata such as the packet size and number of packets can still be observed by an adversary. This is commonly known as fingerprinting and website fingerprinting attacks have received a lot of attention recently as a known victim's website visits can be accurately predicted, deanonymizing that victim's web usage. Most of the previous work have been performed in laboratory settings and have made two assumptions: 1) a victim visits one website at a time, and 2) the whole website visit with all the network packets can be observed. To validate these assumptions, a new private webbrowser extension called WebTracker is deployed with real users. WebTracker records the websites visited, when the website loading starts, and when the website loading finishes. Results show that users' browsing patterns are different than what was previously assumed.  Users may browse the web in a way that acts as a countermeasure against website fingerprinting due to multiple websites overlapping and downloading at the same time. Over 15% of websites overlap with at least one other website and each overlap was 66 seconds. Moreover, each overlap happens roughly 9 seconds after the first website download has started. Thus, this reinforces some previous work that the beginning of a website is more important than the end for a website fingerprinting attack.

                    With the DNS traffic, an eavesdropper can easily identify websites that a user is visiting. In order to address this concern of web privacy, encryption is used by performing a DNS lookup over HTTPS. In this paper, we studied whether the encrypted DoH traffic could be exploited to identify websites that a user has visited. This is a different type of website fingerprinting by analyzing encrypted DNS network traffic rather than the network traffic between the client and the web server. DNS typically uses fewer network packets than a website download. Our model and algorithm can accurately predict one out of 10,000 websites with a 95% accuracy using the first 50 DoH packets. In the open-world environment with 100,000 websites, our model achieves an F1-score of 93%.

We show that the dominant sentiment reactions on social media are neutral, while the most discussed topics by social network users are about health issues. This paper examines the countries that attracted a higher number of posts and reactions from people, as well as the distribution of health-related topics discussed in the most mentioned countries. We shed light on the temporal shift of topics over countries. Our results show that posts from the top-mentioned countries influence and attract more reactions worldwide than posts from other parts of the world. <div align="right">

                  <div class="card-body description">Deep neural network models are susceptible to malicious manipulations even in the black-box settings. Providing explanations for DNN models offers a sense of security by human involvement, which reveals whether the sample is benign or adversarial even though previous studies achieved a high attack success rate. However, interpretable deep learning systems (IDLSes) are shown to be susceptible to adversarial manipulations in white-box settings. Attacking IDLSes in black-box settings is challenging and remains an open research domain. In this work, we propose a black-box version of the white-box AdvEdge approach against IDLSes, which is query-efficient and gradient-free without obtaining any knowledge of the target DNN model and its coupled interpreter. Our approach takes advantage of transfer-based and score-based techniques using the effective microbial genetic algorithm (MGA). We achieve a high attack success rate with a small number of queries and high similarity in interpretations between adversarial and benign samples. <div align="right">

                  <div class="card-body description">The rapid pace of malware development and the widespread use of code obfuscation, polymorphism, and morphing techniques pose a considerable challenge to detecting and analyzing malware. Today, it is difficult for antivirus applications to use traditional signature-based detection methods to detect morphing malware. Thus, the emergence of structure graph-based detection methods has become a hope to solve this challenge. In this work, we propose a method for detecting malware using graphs’ spectral heat and wave signatures, which are efficient and size- and permutation-invariant. We extracted 250 and 1,000 heat and wave representations, and we trained and tested heat and wave representations on eight machine learning classifiers. We used a dataset of 37,537 unpacked Windows malware executables and extracted the control flow graph (CFG) of each Windows malware to obtain the spectral representations. Our experimental results showed that by using heat and wave spectral graph theory, the best malware analysis accuracy reached 95.9%. <div align="right">

                    <div class="card-body description">This study proposes a malware detection system robust to adversarial attacks. We examine the performance of the state-of-the-art methods against adversarial IoT software crafted using the graph embedding and augmentation techniques; namely, we study the robustness of such methods against two black-box adversarial methods, GEA and SGEA, to generate Adversarial Examples (AEs) with reduced overhead, and keeping their practicality intact. Our comprehensive experimentation with GEA-based AEs show the relation between misclassification and the graph size of the injected sample. Upon optimization and with small perturbation, by use of SGEA, all IoT malware samples are misclassified as benign. This highlights the vulnerability of current detection systems under adversarial settings. With the landscape of possible adversarial attacks, we then propose DL-FHMC, a fine-grained hierarchical learning approach for malware detection and classification, that is robust to AEs with a capability to detect 88.52% of the malicious AEs. <div align="right">

                    <div class="card-body description">Machine Learning (ML) based Network Intrusion Systems (NIDSs) operate on flow features which are obtained from flow exporting protocols (i.e., NetFlow). Recent success of ML and Deep Learning (DL) based NIDS solutions assume such flow information (e.g., avg. packet size) is obtained from all packets of the flow. However, often in practice flow exporter is deployed on commodity devices where packet sampling is inevitable. As a result, applicability of such ML based NIDS solutions in the presence of sampling (i.e., when flow information is obtained from sampled set of packets instead of full traffic) is an open question. In this study, we explore the impact of packet sampling on the performance and efficiency of ML-based NIDSs. Unlike previous work, our proposed evaluation procedure is immune to different settings of flow export stage. Hence, it can provide a robust evaluation of NIDS even in the presence of sampling. Through sampling experiments we established that malicious flows with shorter size (i.e., number of packets) are likely to go unnoticed even with mild sampling rates such as 1/10 and 1/100. Next, using the proposed evaluation procedure we investigated the impact of various sampling techniques on NIDS detection rate and false alarm rate. Detection rate and false alarm rate is computed for three sampling rates (i.e., 1/10, 1/100, 1/1000), for four different sampling techniques and for three (two tree-based, one deep learning based) classifiers. Experimental results show that systematic linear sampler - SketFlow performs better compared to non-linear samplers such as Sketch Guided and Fast Filtered sampling. We also found that random forest classifier with SketchFlow sampling was a better combination. The combination showed higher detection rate and lower false alarm rate across multiple sampling rates compared to other sampler-classifier combinations. Our results are consistent in multiple sampling rates, exceptional case is observed for Sketch Guided Samp... <div align="right">

End-to-end, Soteria's representation ensures a simple yet powerful randomization property of the used classification features, making it difficult even for a powerful adversary to launch a successful attack. Soteria also employs a deep learning approach, consisting of an auto-encoder for detecting adversarial examples, and a CNN architecture for detecting and classifying malware samples. <div align="right">

This approach applies data selection for specific-task translations by dividing the corpus into smaller and topic-related corpora using clustering process. We investigate the effect of different approaches for clustering the bilingual data on the language model adaptation process in terms of translation quality using the Europarl corpus WMT07 that includes bilingual data for English-Spanish, English-German and English-French. <div align="right">

                    <div class="card-body description">In this study, we investigate the robustness of such models against adversarial attacks. Our approach crafts the adversarial IoT software using the Subgraph Embedding and Augmentation (SGEA) method that reduces the embedded size required to cause misclassification. Intensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. We observed that SGEA approach is able to misclassify all IoT malware samples as benign by embedding an average size of 6.8 nodes. This highlights that the current detection systems are prone to adversarial examples attacks; thus, there is a need to build more robust systems to detect such manipulated features generated by adversarial examples. <div align="right">
